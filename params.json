In addition \r\nto that, the hand/finger tracking technique is used as a tool of the computer, \r\nacting as an external device in our computer, similar to a keyboard and \r\na mouse.      \r\n# Time Line\r\n1 Creat github homepage\r\n# To Do List\r\n1.分配任务，创建项目链接   \r\n2.阅读参考文献，寻找合适算法，确定待实现方案   \r\n\r\n# Reference\r\n[1].
