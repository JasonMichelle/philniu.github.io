图像分析与理解项目：3D Hand Tracking      
Members: 牛群杰 罗攀 陈福坤 李国胜
# Introduction
In the field of technology and image processing, hand/finger tracking is 
a high-resolution technique that is employed to know the consecutive position 
of the hands/fingers of the user and hence represent objects in 3D. In addition 
to that, the hand/finger tracking technique is used as a tool of the computer, 
acting as an external device in our computer, similar to a keyboard and 
a mouse.
